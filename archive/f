Help on function rhs in module pydy.codegen.ode_function_generators:

rrhhss(*args)
    Returns the derivatives of the states, i.e. numerically evaluates the right
    hand side of the first order differential equation.
    
    x' = f(x, t, r, p)
    
    Parameters
    ==========
    x : ndarray, shape(4,)
        The state vector is ordered as such:
            - q0(t)
            - q1(t)
            - qdot0(t)
            - qdot1(t)
    t : float
        The current time.
    r : dictionary; ndarray, shape(1,); function
    
        There are three options for this argument. (1) is more flexible but
        (2) and (3) are much more efficient.
    
        (1) A dictionary that maps the specified functions of time to floats,
        ndarrays, or functions that produce ndarrays. The keys can be a single
        specified symbolic function of time or a tuple of symbols. The total
        number of symbols must be equal to 1. If the value is a
        function it must be of the form g(x, t), where x is the current state
        vector ndarray and t is the current time float and it must return an
        ndarray of the correct shape. For example::
    
          r = {a: 1.0,
               (d, b) : np.array([1.0, 2.0]),
               (e, f) : lambda x, t: np.array(x[0], x[1]),
               c: lambda x, t: np.array(x[2])}
    
        (2) A ndarray with the specified values in the correct order and of the
        correct shape.
    
        (3) A function that must be of the form g(x, t), where x is the current
        state vector and t is the current time and it must return an ndarray of
        the correct shape.
    
        The specified inputs are, in order:
            - f(t)
    p : dictionary len(8) or ndarray shape(8,)
        Either a dictionary that maps the constants symbols to their numerical
        values or an array with the constants in the following order:
            - (l0,)
            - a0
            - m0
            - m1
            - J0
            - J1
            - d1
            - g
    
    Returns
    =======
    dx : ndarray, shape(4,)
        The derivative of the state vector.
